# Window Design
- Windows: 1.0, 1.28, 2.56 s
- Overlap: 50%
- Rationale: 1.0–1.28 s approximate one gait cycle at 100–120 steps/min; 2.56 s provides multi-step context while keeping stationarity. 50% overlap balances temporal resolution and sample independence.
- Grouping: subject-wise 5-fold CV; trials selected in a balanced manner across healthy/ortho/neuro.
